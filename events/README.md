# Behavior Induction and Event Creation

  ### Entity Activity Generation
  Nodes on the virtual network must use the network like the nodes observed in the real-world networks the simulations are based on. This includes the services/protocols used as well as the volume and inter-activity time deltas. This software component will generate a series of node activities, which will be used to create the observational record input for detection algorithms.
